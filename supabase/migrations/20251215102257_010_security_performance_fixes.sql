  # Security and Performance Fixes

  1. Overview
    - Adds missing index for foreign key on commissions.subscription_id
    - Optimizes all RLS policies by wrapping auth.uid() in (select auth.uid())
      to prevent re-evaluation for each row
    - Updates security definer views to use invoker where appropriate

  2. Changes
    - Creates index on commissions.subscription_id for FK performance
    - Recreates RLS policies with optimized auth function calls
    - Converts security definer views to security invoker

  3. Security
    - No changes to access control logic
    - Performance optimization only
    - Maintains existing security model

# Test Mode & Real-Time Timeline Testing Guide

## Overview

Test mode is now **ENABLED** for the Talk-To-My-Lawyer platform. This allows you to test the complete letter generation and review workflow without processing real Stripe payments.

## What's Been Configured

### ✅ Environment Variables
- **Local Development** (`.env.local`):
  - `ENABLE_TEST_MODE="true"`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE="true"`

- **Vercel Production**:
  - `ENABLE_TEST_MODE="true"`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE="true"`

### ✅ Test Mode Indicators
Visual indicators have been added to help you know when test mode is active:

1. **Subscription Page** (`/dashboard/subscription`)
   - Amber warning banner at the top
   - Shows: "Test Mode Active - Stripe payments are simulated"

2. **Admin Review Center** (`/secure-admin-gateway/review`)
   - Amber warning banner at the top
   - Shows: "Test Mode Active - You're reviewing letters created with simulated payments"

## How Test Mode Works

### For Subscribers

When `ENABLE_TEST_MODE=true`:

1. **Letter Generation** - Works normally
   - User fills out letter intake form
   - AI generates draft using OpenAI
   - Letter status: `generating` → `pending_review`

2. **Checkout Process** - Bypasses Stripe completely
   - User clicks "Subscribe" or "Upgrade"
   - Instead of redirecting to Stripe checkout:
     - Subscription is created directly in database
     - Status set to `active` immediately
     - Credits/letters allocated instantly
   - No payment processing
   - No Stripe session ID
   - Redirects to: `/dashboard/subscription?success=true&test=true`

3. **Letter Review** - Works exactly like production
   - Timeline modal shows real-time updates
   - Subscribes to Supabase Realtime for status changes
   - Updates when admin reviews/approves letter

### For Admins

Admin workflow is **identical** to production:
- Review letters in Review Center
- Click "Review Letter" to start review
- Edit content, approve, or reject
- All actions trigger real-time updates for subscribers

## Real-Time Timeline Integration

The GenerationTrackerModal (`/components/generation-tracker-modal.tsx`) uses **Supabase Realtime** to provide instant status updates:

### Timeline Stages

1. **Stage 1: Draft Prepared**
   - Status: `generating` or `draft`
   - Shows: "Preparing your draft based on the details you provided"
   - Icon: Loading spinner

2. **Stage 2: Attorney Review**
   - Status: `pending_review` → "Waiting for an attorney to begin review"
   - Status: `under_review` → "An attorney is reviewing and may edit your letter"
   - Icon: Loading spinner (active) or Checkmark (completed)

3. **Stage 3: Final Status**
   - Status: `approved` → "Your letter is approved and ready to view"
   - Status: `rejected` → "Our team left notes. Please review and resubmit"
   - Status: `failed` → "We could not prepare your draft. Please try again"
   - Icon: Checkmark (approved) or X (rejected/failed)

### How Real-Time Updates Work

**Technology**: Supabase Realtime via WebSocket
- No polling required
- Instant updates (< 100ms latency)
- Automatic reconnection if disconnected
- Fallback polling every 12 seconds as backup

**Event Flow**:
1. Admin changes letter status in database
2. Supabase sends `postgres_changes` event via WebSocket
3. GenerationTrackerModal receives event
4. React state updates
5. UI re-renders with new status
6. Timeline animates to next stage

**Code Reference** (`generation-tracker-modal.tsx`):
```typescript
// Lines 55-67: Supabase Realtime subscription
const channel = supabase
  .channel(`letter-status:${letterId}`)
  .on(
    "postgres_changes",
    { event: "UPDATE", schema: "public", table: "letters", filter: `id=eq.${letterId}` },
    (payload) => {
      const nextStatus = payload.new?.status as LetterStatus | undefined
      if (nextStatus) {
        setStatus(nextStatus)  // Triggers re-render
      }
    },
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## Complete End-to-End Test Flow

### Prerequisites
1. Restart development server to load new environment variables:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Open two browser windows:
   - **Window A**: Regular browser (subscriber view)
   - **Window B**: Incognito/Private mode (admin view)

### Step-by-Step Testing

## Troubleshooting Real-Time Updates

If timeline modal does **NOT** update automatically:

### 1. Check Supabase Realtime Connection

**Open Browser DevTools** (F12):
- Go to **Network** tab
- Filter by "ws" or "realtime"
- Look for WebSocket connection to Supabase
- Status should be "101 Switching Protocols" (active connection)
- Look for messages being sent/received

### 2. Check Console for Errors

**In Subscriber Window (Window A)**:
- Open DevTools Console
- Look for errors related to Supabase or Realtime
- Common issues:
  - "Failed to establish WebSocket connection"
  - "Realtime subscription error"
  - CORS errors

### 3. Verify Environment Variables

**On server**:
```bash
# Check if env vars are loaded
echo $ENABLE_TEST_MODE  # Should output: true
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE  # Should output: true
```

**In browser console** (Window A):
```javascript
// Check if public env var is accessible
console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE)  // Should log: "true"
```

### 4. Manual Refresh Test

If real-time doesn't work:
- Change letter status via admin
- Manually refresh subscriber page
- Status **should** still update (via polling fallback)
- Polling interval: every 12 seconds

### 5. Check Database Status

**Using Supabase Dashboard**:
1. Go to Table Editor
2. Find `letters` table
3. Locate your test letter by ID
4. Check `status` column
5. Verify it matches what admin set

**Expected status flow**:
```
generating → pending_review → under_review → approved
```

## Test Mode vs Production Mode

### Test Mode (Current)
✅ No Stripe checkout page
✅ Subscriptions created instantly
✅ No payment processing
✅ No webhooks
✅ Amber warning banners visible
✅ Perfect for development and testing
❌ Not suitable for real customers

### Production Mode
❌ Requires Stripe configuration
✅ Real payment processing
✅ Webhook verification
✅ Stripe Checkout UI
✅ Customer payment methods saved
✅ Real subscriptions with billing

### Switching Between Modes

**To disable test mode** (switch to production):

1. **Local**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.local
   ENABLE_TEST_MODE="false"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE="false"
   ```

2. **Vercel**:
   ```bash
   npx vercel env rm ENABLE_TEST_MODE production --token={TOKEN} --yes
   npx vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE production --token={TOKEN} --yes

   echo "false" | npx vercel env add ENABLE_TEST_MODE production --token={TOKEN}
   echo "false" | npx vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE production --token={TOKEN}
   ```

3. **Restart** server and **redeploy** to Vercel

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run the complete test flow** following the steps above
2. **Verify real-time updates work** in both windows simultaneously
3. **Test edge cases**:
   - What if network disconnects during review?
   - What if admin rejects letter instead of approving?
   - What if subscriber closes modal mid-review?
4. **Document any issues** encountered during testing
5. **Once testing is complete**, decide whether to keep test mode enabled or switch to production mode

---

## Support & Debugging

If you encounter any issues during testing:

1. **Check server logs** for errors
2. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
3. **Check Supabase logs** for database/realtime issues
4. **Verify all environment variables** are loaded correctly
5. **Try the manual refresh test** to isolate real-time issues

For reference, the key files involved:
- Checkout: `/app/api/create-checkout/route.ts` (lines 13, 286-367)
- Timeline Modal: `/components/generation-tracker-modal.tsx` (lines 55-67)
- Admin Review: `/app/api/letters/[id]/approve/route.ts`
- Realtime Config: Supabase Realtime enabled on `letters` table

## Congratulations!

You now have a fully functional test mode environment where you can:
- Test the complete letter workflow without Stripe
- See real-time status updates as admin reviews letters
- Verify the entire subscriber experience
- Debug and iterate quickly

Happy testing! 🎉
